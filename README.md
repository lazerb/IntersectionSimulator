About
========
This is a simulation of a left turn perpendicular intersection. Written in Actionscript 2.0 in Flash Professional. Written by Toviah Botwinik for The Young Driver Research Initiative for the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

Features
=========
This simulation features two cars, one "player" car and one "NPC" car. Both cars' start time are controllable by the user.
Additionally, the velocity of the NPC car and the acceleration of the player car can be controlled.
Lastly, there is a ghost feature, which will display an aproximated trajectory of the cars if the simulation is paused. This can be used to tell if the cars will collide or not.
